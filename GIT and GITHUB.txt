- git status:- this command is used to check the status of the changes in the files/folder.

- git add filename :- this command is used to add the untracked files to staging area(tracked files).
- when we have multiple files to track then we can use a command called "git add ."
- once we use this above command all untracked files become tracked files and they are ready to push into remote repo(github).

- git commit -m "message" :- this command is used to write commit messages for changes done for the files.

- once we push the code to the remote repo and agin if we made some changes in the files that changes will not update directly on the remote repo.
- we have to commit again and we have to push the code again into repo by using the above commands.
